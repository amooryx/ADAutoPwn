# ADAutoPwn
What is ADAutoPwn? ADAutoPwn is an envisioned or prototype tool designed to perform fully autonomous Active Directory (AD) penetration testing. The idea is to automate the entire process of discovering, exploiting, and escalating privileges within an AD environment without human intervention, from initial enumeration to domain dominance.
